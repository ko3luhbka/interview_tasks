How Python lists works under the hood:  
https://habr.com/en/post/273045/

Empty list size: 72 bytes.
When appending the first element, 4 memory cells allocated, 8 bytes each.
The list size grows after adding the 5th element. This is how memory is allocated:
0, 4, 8, 16, 25, 35, 46, 58, 72, 88.
Time complexity: O(1) (amortized).
